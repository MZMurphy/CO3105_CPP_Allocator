Hey 

I haven't done any work I've just played aroud w/ the make and directory structure to try and make things easier for us when we do start.






- `main` is the entry point (GenAlloc).
- `Allocator` is the logic for the actual algortithm.
- `Staff`, `Student`, `Projects` are thier respective classes (that I think you wanted to divide the work into?)
- `makefile` builds GenAlloc.
